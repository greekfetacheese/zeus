 ### Zeus is also available on [radicle](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad:zNS8uWXgE8r87Zb8ito1wzg84gbc)
 ### RID: `rad:zNS8uWXgE8r87Zb8ito1wzg84gbc`
 
 
## Installation
**You may need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)**

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/greekfetacheese/zeus/releases)
2. Zeus is portable, you just need to extract the folder and run the `zeus` executable.

**Zeus saves and loads its data from the current directory it exists, so if you want to move it move it with the entire folder**


## Supported Chains
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- Base
- Binance Smart Chain

## Supported Platforms
- Windows
- Linux

## Minimum System Requirements
- RAM: 8GB (For wallet recovery)

## How Wallet management work in Zeus
Zeus is **seedless**, meaning that you don't need to have a seed phrase or a private key to access your wallet.

The first time you run Zeus you will be prompted to enter a **username** and a **password**. This will be used to derive your
master wallet **(Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet)** and you can generate as many wallets under it as you want.

You can also import an existing wallet by entering the mnemonic phrase or a private key, but these cannot be recovered
if you lose your vault.

It is very important that you don't forget your **username** and **password**, otherwise wallet recovery will be
impossible.

---

## How the wallet recovery works
Given that **username** and **password** a hash is generated using [Argon2Id](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) 
with the following parameters:
- **Salt:** SHA512 of the username
- **Memory cost:** 8192 MB
- **Iterations:** 96
- **Parallelism:** 1
- **Byte length:** 64 bytes

These parameters are constants and will not change in the near future.

Then a private key is derived based on the [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) standard using the hash as the seed.
This private key then is used as your master wallet.

---

## How safe this recovery method is?
If we assume that the username and password have a decent entropy (at least 128bits 16+ characters) and the password is
not ever **exposed** in past breaches, it is practically impossible for someone to brute force your wallet.

## Connecting to dapps
It is possible to connect Zeus to dapps through the [wallet-connector](https://github.com/greekfetacheese/zeus/tree/main/wallet-connector) extension, for chromium based browsers (Chrome, Brave etc.).

Currently the extension is not listed in the Chrome Web Store, so you will need to install it manually.

## Installing the extension
1. Download the wallet-connector.zip from the latest [release](https://github.com/greekfetacheese/zeus/releases)
2. You can use this [guide](https://bashvlas.com/blog/install-chrome-extension-in-developer-mode) on how to install the extension in developer mode.


## Features

- **Connect to dapps:** Still WIP, some dapps work well, some don't.
- **Wallet Management:** Import, export and create new wallets under the same master wallet.
- **Crypto Transactions:** Send ETH and ERC-20 tokens.
- **Cross-Chain Bridging:** Bridge ETH between the supported chains using [Across](https://across.to/) (**BNB is not supported**).
- **Basic Portfolio Tracking:** Monitor your assets with a simple interface.
- **Swap Tokens:** Swap tokens on the Uniswap protocol (through the [Universal Router](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/deployments)).
- **Transaction Simulations:** Zeus run local EVM simulations using [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) to verify transactions before you submit them, what you see on the screen is what you will get.
- **MEV Protect:** For transactions that are vulnerable to MEV by default Zeus uses mev-protect rpc endpoints (ETH mainnet only).

 Zeus has been designed to work with what the Ethereum RPC API provides, it does not rely on any kind of 3rd-party service to work, you simply give it an rpc endpoint and its ready to go.

 Because of that it does not automatically index data like token approvals, balances etc..

 By default it uses free public rpc endpoints obtained from [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/).
 You can of course bring your own endpoints and disable the default ones

## Security
- **Strong encryption:** Zeus uses the [Argon2Id](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) as a KDF and [xChaCha20Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) as the encryption algorithm to derive the master wallet and encrypt the `Vault`.
- **No private key leaks:** Zeus uses [secure-types](https://github.com/greekfetacheese/secure-types) to handle private keys and other sensintive data in-memory. This makes it extremely hard for an attacker/malware to extract any private keys. (Unlike browser extension wallets)
- **No telemetry:** Zeus does not need neither communicates with any third-party server, everything you do stays local on your computer.

## Bugs/Issues
I'm not aware of any major bugs, feel free to open an issue if you find any.
